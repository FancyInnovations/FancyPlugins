# New and Reworked Documentation

We are happy to announce that we have reworked our documentation.
With the new monorepo, the docs are now even closer to the code, which makes it easier to keep them up to date.
In addition, we have improved the structure and added new content.

!!!
You can find the new documentation at [https://docs.fancyinnovations.com](https://docs.fancyinnovations.com)
!!!

## Reasons

There are three main reasons why we reworked our documentation:

### Sunsetting of Writerside

WriterSide was the old documentation tool we used. It was a great tool, but they no longer support it (only for them internally).
The tool was still in beta and had some limitations. It also required to have the custom IDE or a plugin installed to edit the documentation.
We wanted to have a more open and flexible solution.

### The old documentation was outdated and not up to date

The old documentation was outdated and not up to date. It was hard to keep it up to date because it was not close to the code.
We often forgot to update the documentation when we changed for example the API or command structure.
With the new monorepo, the docs are now even closer to the code, which makes it easier to keep them up to date.

### We wanted to have a better structure and more content

The old documentation was not well-structured and had only a few pages. We wanted to have a better structure and more content.
We also wanted to have a better navigation and search functionality.

## What's new?

### More detailed content

We have added more detailed content to the documentation. All pages are better structured and have more information.
There are some fancy images now too.

### Better search functionality

The new tool we use for the documentation has a built-in search functionality. You can now easily search for specific topics.

### New sections

We not only reworked the existing documentation but also added new sections.
For example, we have added a section about development guidelines and best practices.
We are also working on a section about the product direction and roadmap. You will find all planned features there.

## Conclusion

We are happy with the new documentation and hope you like it too.
