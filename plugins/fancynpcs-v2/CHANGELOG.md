- Dropped support for 1.20.x
- Added per npc visibility (similar to FancyHolograms)
- Fixed changing type to ender_dragon not taking effect
- Fixed skin identifiers being occasionally being overridden when two placeholders returned the same username
- Fixed action list being copied incorrectly when using the copy command
- Fixed npc not directly looking at player when turn_to_player is enabled and npc is scaled
- Fixed MiniMessage component not being validated before sending packets (causing player disconnects)

Recently there are many new contributors to the project. A warm welcome to all new contributors, and thank you for your help!
